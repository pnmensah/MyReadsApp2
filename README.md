# MyReads Project

This is the MyReads Project for Udacity's React Nanodegree course. In the MyReads project, you'll create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

## TL;DR

To get started:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install` and `npm install react-router-dom`
- start the development server with `npm start`
